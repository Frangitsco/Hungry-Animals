The Pizza Farmer

In this game you are the Pizza Farmer and your task is to feed as many hungry animals as you can.

Move left, right, forward, backward with the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Shoot the pizzas with the space bar to feed the animals.

The Pizza Farmer starts the game session with 5 lives, he loses life in the following occasions:
- If an animal reaches the opposite side of the playground without being fed
- If an animal hits him

The console updates your score each time you feed an animal, it shows how many lives you have left each time you die and it shows “Game Over” when you lose all your 5 lives.

Tips:
Be careful because each animal type runs at a different speed, the animal generates at random locations and they have different hunger bars. For example the moose needs 3 pizzas to get fed, the dog only one.

Good luck!
